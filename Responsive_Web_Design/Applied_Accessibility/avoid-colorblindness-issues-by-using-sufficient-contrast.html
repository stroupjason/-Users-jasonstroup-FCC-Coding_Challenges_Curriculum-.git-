<!-- Assignment:
Camper Cat is experimenting with using color for his blog text and background,
but his current combination of a greenish background-color with maroon text
color has a 2.5:1 contrast ratio. You can easily adjust the lightness of the
colors since he declared them using the CSS hsl() property (which stands for
hue,saturation, lightness) by changing the third argument. Increase the
background-color lightness value from 35% to 55%, and decrease the color
lightness value from 20% to 15%. This improves the contrast to 5.9:1. -->

    <h2>A Word on the Recent Catnip Doping Scandal</h2>
    <p>The influence that catnip has on feline behavior is well-documented,
        and its use as an herbal supplement in competitive ninja circles remains
        controversial. Once again, the debate to ban the substance is brought
        to the public's attention after the high-profile win of Kittytron, a
        long-time proponent and user of the green stuff, at the Claw of Fury
        tournament.</p>
    <p>As I've stated in the past, I firmly believe a true ninja's skills must
        come from within, with no external influences. My own catnip use shall
        continue as purely recreational.</p>
