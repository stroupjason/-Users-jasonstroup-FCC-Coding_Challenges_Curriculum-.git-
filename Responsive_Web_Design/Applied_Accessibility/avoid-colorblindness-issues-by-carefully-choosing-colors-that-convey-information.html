<!-- Assignment:
Camper Cat is testing different styles for an important button, but the yellow
(#FFFF33) background-color and the green (#33FF33) text color are neighboring
hues on the color wheel and virtually indistinguishable for some colorblind users.
(Their similar lightness also fails the contrast ratio check). Change the text
color to a dark blue (#003366) to solve both problems. -->
